# PALP: a Package for Analyzing Lattice Polytopes 

This is a fork of the [PALP GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/stringstuwien/PALP). The `upstream` branch tracks the `main` branch of the original repository, and other branches of this repository contain changes to allow the implementation of Python bindings. More information about the PALP package can be found at the [PALP website](http://hep.itp.tuwien.ac.at/~kreuzer/CY/CYpalp.html).
